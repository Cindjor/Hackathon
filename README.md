We started with our instructor's MVC program that he wrote for us to learn Python and adapted it to our needs. 

We created What's Good as an introduction to APIs and how to properly call them to get data from various websites. 

Our hackathon's only rules were to use, at a minimum, one of two APIs: Google Maps and Twilio for our web application. 

Our  plan was to have Google Maps pinpoint your location and then call the local events around your location using Eventbrite's API. Google would use the addresses from Eventbrite and pin the location of the local events with a short description that included the time, location, and a button to "remind you" of the event. The reminder would be a text sent through the Twilio APIs to your phone with the information about the event that was selected.

In the end we used 2.5 days to build the website from scratch while learning how to use APIs and AJAX requests on the fly to get the website working properly. We used basic HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front end and a Python MVC for our backend. We also used MySQL for our database that connected to our MVC framework.

We utilized Google Maps API, Eventbrite, and Twilio APIs to make a webpage that pulled local events from your current location and would text you a reminder of a chosen event.
